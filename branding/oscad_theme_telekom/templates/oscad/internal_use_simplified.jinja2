	For each of the open source software packages that you want to use
	OSCAd would answer that you do not have to do anything; and for some 
	of these packages OSCAd would add that you must respect some interdictions. 
	So, if you respect all the following interdictions for each piece 
	of open source software you will certainly comply with all of the licenses.
