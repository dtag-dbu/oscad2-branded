oscad2-branded
==============

This repository contains the additional code needed to integrate the
brands of Deutsche Telekom into OSCAd 2 and to reproduce the
[public OSCAd 2 server](http://opensource.telekom.net/oscad) of
Deutsche Telekom.

Although the license permits the use of these sources, under most
circumstances you will be better off if you stick to the unmodified
OSCAd 2 available from it's
[primary repository](http://github.com/AmadeusITGroup/oscad):  

 * The primary repository may contain features not yet present in this
   version. 
 * The primary repository already supports a French interface in
   addition to English and German. This version does not and probably
   never will.
 * The original OSCAd 2 is designed for and tested against several
   versions of Python and different operating systems.  This version
   is tested against whatever environment the above mentioned server
   happens to run.
 * The original OSCAd 2 is easier to install because it is not split
   into two parts.

If you still choose to use this version, you need to be aware of the
fact, that, although the license grants you the permission to use,
copy, and distribute the code under copyright and patent law,
**this permission does not extend to logos, names, trademarks, etc.**
This means, you may need to alter or remove some element of the user
interface before you can deploy your own copy of the application.
